The mission was to get all 7 pieces in the same wallet by any means necessary. Most holders decided to form teams and contribute their piece to a group. Those who completed this task were able to transfer those 7 individual pieces (hyperlink) for 7 editions of the final playground (hyperlink). The final playground served as an access token to acquire a physical version of the Creature Playground."
